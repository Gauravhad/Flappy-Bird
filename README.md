# Flappy-Bird
2D game where players guide a bird through gaps between pipes. The bird flaps upward with each tap, while gravity pulls it down, adding a layer of challenge. The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible without crashing. +1 Score for passing between pipes. Colliding with a pipe or the ground results in game over.
